# Predict Telco Customer Churn with Logistic Regression and Decision Tree

Customer churn occurs when a customer stops using a business's products or services. Customer retention is critical to the business as it is often more costly to acquire new customers compared to retaining existing ones. As such, predicting customer churn will help in early detection of customers who are at risks of leaving a service/product, allowing the business to take proactive measures in prioritising retention efforts with these customers.

I have covered the following in this project:
- Resolving imbalanced class issues using SMOTE
- Detecting multi-collinearity in independent variables via correlation matrix and VIF
- Logistic regression model
- Decision tree model
- Model Experimentation and Fine-tuning
- Model output intepretation

I have provided the detailed codes and explanation in the Jupyter Notebook.
