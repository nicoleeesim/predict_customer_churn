The model performed well in terms of accuracy due to the accracy paradox - given that majority of the test data are of the majority class, a model that predicts the majority class for all the test data will have a high number of correct predictions. This results in a misleading accuracy score. \n- As such, I trained a second model (1B) with a balanced data set to evaluate if this would improve the recall and precision. Although the accuracy score decreased slightly to 0.746, the recall score has improved to 0.715. However, the precision score decreased to 0.508. This is the trade-off for correcting the dataset. As the model is now exposed to more data from the minority class (churn), more of its prediction now leans towards the minority class, resulting in higher false positives and thus, a lower precision. \n- Given both models, I would pick the second model (1B) as it has a higher recall. In this customer churn prediction case, false positives are less costly compared to false negatives. In a false positive case, the firm would proactively engage a non-churn customer as the model has wrongly predicted that the customer would churn. In a false negative case, the firm would neglect a churning customer as the model has wrongly predicted that the customer would not churn. The latter would cause greater financial loss to the firm as it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to retain one. \n\n**Intepreting model output  [4]**\n- StreamingMovies, PaperlessBilling and gender have no significant effect on the log odds of customers churning.
